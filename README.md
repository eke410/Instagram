Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Better way to add profile photo to user. 
2. How to use collection views better.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- implementing infinite scrolling - accidentally made 4000 API requests in the span of a few minutes
- adding profile picture feature - figuring how to incorporate that extra property into PFUser object
- collection view - cells were not sizing the way I wanted them to
